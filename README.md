## Why did this exist?
I(as the developer) have not yet seen a lightweight application nor online website that offers music directly into the Roblox Server. Instead, they have their own database that stores the roblox musics.

## Support
If someone would like to add features to the application, please contact me with my github social links. You can also support me on my development journey
