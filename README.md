## Why did this exist?
I(as the developer) have not yet seen a lightweight application nor online website that offers music directly into the Roblox Server. Instead, they have their own database that stores the roblox musics.

If someone would like to add features to the application, please contact me with my github social links. You can also support me on my development journey
